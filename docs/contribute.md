title: Contribute to Vorple development
---

The Vorple source code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/vorple).

The source code is divided into the following repositories:

* **[vorple](https://github.com/vorple/vorple)**: the main JavaScript library
* **[haven](https://github.com/vorple/haven)**: the interpreter engine layer
* **[Git](https://github.com/vorple/Git)**: a fork of the Git interpreter for [Emscripten](http://emscripten.org) compilation from C to JavaScript
* **[cheapglk](https://github.com/vorple/cheapglk)**: a fork of the cheapglk API with Vorple bindings
* **[inform6](https://github.com/vorple/inform6)**: the Inform 6 library
* **[inform7](https://github.com/vorple/inform7)**: the Inform 7 extensions and templates
* **[contributions](https://github.com/vorple/contributions)**: unofficial contributions from the community
* **[vorple-if.com](https://github.com/vorple/vorple-if.com)**: web site and documentation

Bug reports can be posted to those repositories (to the "issues" page.) You need
a free GitHub account to post issues. If you're not sure which repository
to post to, choose the one for the Inform version you're using 
([inform6](https://github.com/vorple/inform6/issues) or 
[inform7](https://github.com/vorple/inform7/issues)), or if it's unrelated to
the Inform libraries, the main [vorple](https://github.com/vorple/vorple/issues) 
repository.

Pull requests are welcome to all repositories, including the documentation!
The [contributions](https://github.com/vorple/contributions) repository is
meant for extensions, libraries and other material that's useful to share but
not general enough to include in the official package.

The Vorple project participants are expected to abide by the terms of the 
[Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).
